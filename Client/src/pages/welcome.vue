                  Created by four students at the University of Florida, PantryPal seeks to impact communites across the US.  
                  For restaurants, fast food chains, hotels, grocery stores, and more who have excess food or food waste, 
                  PantryPal is an app that allows for businesses to easily donate their leftovers to local shelters and community 
                  organizations. Unlike complicated, larger scale food donation operations PantryPal will have a local and 
                  community-centric focus, making food donation a simple and seamless experience between community organizations and establishments.
